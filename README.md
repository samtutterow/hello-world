# hello-world

If you've found your home in the world of work, look me up, i want to hear your story.
If you're fascinated by the human side of a great story, come find me.
I want to collect the career stories of the world's happiest workers.
Sounds polyanna, but I do believe there is a place out there for evereyone.

Also interested in world football (and US National Teams)
...drinking old world wine, mixing bourbon drinks, and great cooking
...Minnesota and the Southeast (US)
